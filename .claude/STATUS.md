## Critical Fixes Completed (Session 5)

### 1. DataTable HTML Structure Bug ✅
**Problem**: Invalid HTML with `<Link>` wrapping `<tr>` elements
**Fix**: Implemented `onClick` handlers with proper navigation
**Files**: `components/DataTable.tsx`
**Impact**: All list pages now render correctly with valid HTML

### 2. Dashboard Server Component Error ✅
**Problem**: Server component with onClick handlers causing React errors
**Fix**: Created `UpcomingJobsTable` client component for interactive rows
**Files**: `app/(dashboard)/page.tsx`, `components/UpcomingJobsTable.tsx`
**Impact**: Dashboard loads without errors

### 3. Calendar Runtime Error ✅
**Problem**: `rating.toFixed is not a function` error
**Fix**: Added type checking before calling `.toFixed()`
**Files**: `app/(dashboard)/calendar/daily/page.tsx`
**Impact**: Calendar loads without errors

### 4. Calendar Horizontal Scroll ✅
**Problem**: Only showed 7am-2pm (missing hours)
**Fix**: Added wrapper div with `min-w-[1200px]` for full day view
**Files**: `app/(dashboard)/calendar/daily/page.tsx`
**Impact**: Full 7am-7pm view with horizontal scrolling
